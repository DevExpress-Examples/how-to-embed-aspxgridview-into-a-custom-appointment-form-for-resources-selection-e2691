# How to embed ASPxGridView into a custom appointment form for resources selection


<p>This example demonstrates how to host the ASPxGridView inside the DropDownWindowTemplate of the ASPxDropDownEdit that is used for multi-resource selection (when ResourceSharing option is enabled). This approach can be useful when you wish to display some additional content along with the resource items (e. g. their images). Please review the Default.aspx.cs and CustomAppointmentForm.ascx for an implementation details.</p>
